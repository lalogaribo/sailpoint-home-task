Firebase v10,"This PR seeks to update the firebase syntax from v8 to v10 and provide a reference of necessary changes for anyone building the project with @latest packages.

Initially, I tired to only update the minimum dependencies of firebase, react and react-dom, but at the end I ran into one issue with `getUserWithUsername` throwing an error about `collection()` not being passed a valid reference even though it was being passed `firestore` and was seemingly working fine in other files. In the end, I decided to just update react/next.js to latest and this resolved the issue.

The following changes are made:
- Update necessary packages to latest
- Fix bug with unheart showing because `exists` was being treated as a boolean instead of a function [Similar PR](https://github.com/fireship-io/next-firebase-course/pull/15)
- Copies react-hook-form updates from https://github.com/fireship-io/next-firebase-course/pull/4 (If updating this course, please integrate the original authors PR first so they are credited)
- Temp fixes `<Link>` containing `<a>` errors with `legacyBehavior`. CSS might need an update after removing `<a>` and `legacyBehavior`. *While writing this PR note, i just realized i blindly added legacyBehavior to all links while getting ready to check in. This is actually only needed on links that contain `<a>`*
- Updates all firebase commands and adds a few TODOs to consider

**Note** This is my first time using firebase so there might be a better implementation. I've placed a few TODOs with points you might need to consider if using this project as a boilerplate.",open,SkylerA
add user={undefined} to UserProfile.js,"What: add user={undefined} to user (line 2 of file ""UserProfile.js"")
Where: UserProfile.js
Why: to avoid TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'photoURL'), (reading 'username') and (reading 'displayName').

Code should look like this:
```
// UI component for user profile
export default function UserProfile({ user={undefined} }) {
  return (
    <div className=""box-center"">
      <img src={user.photoURL || '/hacker.png'} className=""card-img-center"" />
      <p>
        <i>@{user.username}</i>
      </p>
      <h1>{user.displayName || 'Anonymous User'}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

Avoid using getFirestore function,"https://github.com/fireship-io/next-firebase-course/blob/96c177d53921570e16a039e483a4fcc279fb2375/lib/firebase.js#L73

Prefers using `firestore` variable directly instead of using `getFirestore` function which may result in inconsistant behaviour (if another firebase app is added).",closed,scorsi
